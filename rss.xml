            <title><![CDATA[The Color Purple]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Color Purple</h1><p>Seeing The Color Purple on Broadway, a decade after its premiere, is like meeting an old friend who has gotten her life together since the last time you saw her. It seems more confident in itself, surer in its sexuality, and it's lost a lot of weight; the cast of John Doyle's revival and the theater in which it's playing are 40 percent smaller than their 2005 equivalents.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/25abc886dcd14c70350f36272dd5bf415e40b485.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hamilton</h1><p>What is left to say? After Founding Father Alexander Hamilton's prodigious quill scratched out 12 volumes of nation-building fiscal and military policy; after Lin-Manuel Miranda turned that titanic achievement (via Ron Chernow's 2004 biography) into the greatest American musical in decades; after every critic in town (including me) praised the Public Theater world premiere to high heaven; and after seeing this language-drunk, rhyme-crazy dynamo a second time, I can only marvel: We've used up all the damn words.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e565cfcce448cca876d11d633c4a47f744bef9eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jersey Boys</h1><p>A star is reborn in Jersey Boys when the puppyish John Lloyd Young takes vocal wing, channeling the legendary thrills and trills of Four Seasons frontman Frankie Valli. As Young's bright falsetto rings through the air, the August Wilson Theatre becomes a rejuvenation room, transforming baby boomer women into screaming Valli girls in the throes of Young love.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7f8278ba06a345334a49d4d0c153c3a427a69a36.jpg"></article>]]></description>
