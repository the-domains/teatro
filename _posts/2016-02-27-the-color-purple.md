description: "Seeing The Color Purple on Broadway, a decade after its premiere, is like meeting an old friend who has gotten her life together since the last time you saw her. It seems more confident in itself, surer in its sexuality, and it's lost a lot of weight; the cast of John Doyle's revival and the theater in which it's playing are 40 percent smaller than their 2005 equivalents."
